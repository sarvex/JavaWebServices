     Tools for publishing the 'predictions' web service:

     # A web server such as Tomcat or Jetty, which publishes the
       service by making it available to clients.

       ## Each is a production-grade web server, which can publish
          web sites and web services alike

     # A deployment tool such as Ant or Maven, which automates the
       otherwise tedious and error-prone task of packaging the
       web service components.
