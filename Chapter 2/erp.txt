    ## My company's ERP system

       ### Inventory control subsystem
       
           -- A program monitors the database to check if
	      inventory items have fallen below a threshold

           -- If so, the monitor program starts up a web-service client 
	      that interacts with the appropriate vendors' web services in
	      order to solicit bids on needed items, select items,
	      place and track orders, etc.
